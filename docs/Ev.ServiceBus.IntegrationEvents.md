# Ev.ServiceBus.IntegrationEvents

Ev.ServiceBus.IntegrationEvents is an extension of [Ev.ServiceBus](https://github.com/EcovadisCode/Ev.ServiceBus) 
that allows you to publish and receive integration events inside an [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) project.

## Getting Started

This package is built upon [Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus/). 
You should have at least basic knowledge of how this package works before using Ev.ServiceBus.IntegrationEvents.

Then, you should look at how to setup Ev.ServiceBus via [this page](https://github.com/EcovadisCode/Ev.ServiceBus/blob/master/docs/SetUp.md)
and this NuGet via the [setup guide page](./IntegrationEvents/Setup.md).

Finally, follow those guides depending on what you need :
* [Publish an integration event](./IntegrationEvents/Publish.md).
* [Subscribe to an integration event](./IntegrationEvents/Subscribe.md).
